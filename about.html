  <!-- About Us Story -->
  <section class="section about-us-story">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>At <strong>Omaggio Global Export</strong>, our journey began with a simple but powerful observation: many Nigerians living abroad were missing a taste of home. Authentic delicacies and high-quality Nigerian products — the small pieces of home that bring comfort and connection — were often <strong>hard to find or too expensive</strong>.</p>

    <p>We realized that for families, entrepreneurs, and students across the world, a single shipment from Nigeria could <strong>reignite memories, celebrate culture, and connect them to their roots</strong>. This inspired our vision: to create a <strong>reliable bridge between Nigerian producers and the global market</strong>.</p>

    <p>Our mission is simple: to <strong>deliver Nigerian goods efficiently and reliably</strong>, empowering local farmers and manufacturers while serving our diaspora and international partners.</p>

    <p>Every shipment tells a story — a mother preparing her favorite meal for her children abroad, a restaurant owner sourcing authentic ingredients, or an entrepreneur building their business with our products. These stories remind us that our work is more than trade — it’s about <strong>connection, culture, and community</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Omaggio Global Export isn’t just a company; it’s a promise:</strong> to make the taste of Nigeria accessible everywhere and give our local producers a platform to <strong>shine on the world stage</strong>.</p>
